             TwistPHP was born as a private project, and as improvements took place, its source-code became public and 
             moved to a GitHub repository in July 2014. The first official release occurred with TwistPHP 2.3.4 in 
             November 2014. Throughout the years, this software has had plenty of time to improve and now, with its last
             stable release (3.0.5), it has a complete MVC architecture, object-oriented design, and brand new method 
             for connecting to the database and creating MySQL queries. The way it has built facilitates its 
             extendibility and reliability. If you want to give it a try or help the project grow you can support it 
             through its GitHub repository below.');

             the new BSD License, thus, it is possible to use it and create open-source web applications for free.
             The first beta version was released in 2006 after several months of development, followed by its official 
             1.0 version in December 2008. A more complete version was released in January 2010; it included a form builder, 
             ActiveRecord, an internal unit test library, and several more features that make Yii a more complete PHP 
             framework than its predecessor. From the beginning, Yii developers decided to keep this project up-to-date
             with the most recent technology. The current version 2.0.15 was released in March 2018 and fully supports 
             PHP 7. There arenâ€™t particular features or special peculiarities to Yii, but it is a pretty solid framework
